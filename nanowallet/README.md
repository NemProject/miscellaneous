# NEM Wallet #

### How to use the NEM Wallet ? ###

After downloading the latest version here https://forum.nem.io/t/nano-wallet-beta-1-1-11-5-000-xem-bug-bounty/2791, extract the NEM-Wallet folder from the archive, then you can simply click on start.html to open the app in your default browser. No installation or local server needed.

### How to import NCC wallet ? ###

Open NCC and your wallet, clicking on user icon should reveal a drop-down menu with "Export for Lightwallet".
Once your have your wallet (.json format), open the NEM Wallet and import the file from the login page. It'll ask for an upgrade and trigger the download of your updated wallet.
Do not delete your old NCC wallet and keep it safe somewhere.

### Imported accounts that are already harvesting using NCC ###

NCC is using a different way to generate the remote associated with an account. NEM Wallet uses BIP32 to generate it deterministically and make everything easier. In order to manage and monitor harvesting, you'll need to deactivate the old remote account from NCC and activate your new remote account from the NEM Wallet. Alternatively you can use a custom delegated public key in the NEM Wallet importance transaction page.

**/!\ Main network: Please note that if you are part of the Supernodes program you'll need to re-enroll your node using your new delegated public key.**

### How to update the NEM Wallet ? ###

Before update make sure that you don't have any wallets stored into the NEM-Wallet folder (you can place them anywhere you want). Then, just delete old version and unzip new version.

###  Dashboard is empty and no balance is showing ###

It is probably that the node you are connected to is down.
Look at the navigation bar, at the top of the page.
If the circle next to `Node` is red, click on it and select another node from the list.
