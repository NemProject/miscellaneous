NEM Developer Kit for Node.js and the browser

**This SDK is just a "draft" for now, lot of things will change as development and feedback goes, but it is enough to start developing great applications.**

[Nano Wallet](https://github.com/NemProject/NanoWallet) will integrate this library instead of everything being merged in the same project. So we have a real separation between core and client.

## Features

- Easy integration
- Organised in namespaces
- Create wallets compatible with Nano Wallet client
- Simple transactions
- Mosaic transactions
- Encrypted, unencrypted and hex messaging
- Create and audit Apostilles
- Create and verify signatures
- Helpers and formatting functions
- 22 NIS API requests with promises
- Websockets for real time blockchain data
- Commented code and examples
- Browser examples ready to use out of the box
