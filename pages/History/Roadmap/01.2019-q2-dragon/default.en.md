| NEM Developer Center (Catapult)  | The Catapult Developer Center contains tools and a knowledge base, including tutorials, documentation, and sample apps.  |
| Catapult Software Development Kits, Round 1 | The Javascript/Typescript and Java SDKs will be updated and 4 more SDKs will be released in alpha stages including PHP, Swift, Python, and Unity. These SDKs will be the core SDKs that will enable powerful apps to be built on Catapult. |
