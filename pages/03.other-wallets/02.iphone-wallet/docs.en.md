The new apps work in conjunction with the recently released [NanoWallet](https://web.archive.org/web/20210814074405/https://forum.nem.io/t/nano-wallet-beta-1-1-11-5-000-xem-bug-bounty/2791). The mobile app allows users to make and scan invoices, export their address book contact, or backup their wallet via QR.  The Android app can serve to work reversely as both a merchant point-of-sale app or a user app. The new apps also work with the Owon's newly released [paper wallet generator](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B_jImF0AZXu-WkJGdlZkVUYtYTg).  To run it, unzip the folder and click on the Voucher+Paper_Wallet.exe file.
