#### 2.1.2 Brain wallet
A brain wallet is a good choice for someone who doesn't want to write down or record a password in any way. Everything you need is memorized and stored in your brain. This provides added security provided you can remember your passphrase with 100% reliability.

When you create a brain wallet, the NanoWallet will create a private key which is derived directly from your passphrase. As the name suggests, a brainwallet is meant to be only secured by a password/passphrase which can be remembered without further backups. You can log into a brain wallet from any NanoWallet on any computer; a .wlt file is **NOT** needed, nor is the private key ever stored in the wallet file as it will be derived each time independently. 

**Because of that reason, we recommend an extra long passphrase, e.g., at least 12 random words.**
