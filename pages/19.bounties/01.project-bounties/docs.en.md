#### The NEM team will be giving bounties for the following projects. 
#### The projects will all have the following three parts.

1. A working demo written in ES6 Javascript running on nodejs (preferred language)
2. Open-sourced code on Github under an MIT license
3. A detailed “how to” blog explaining exactly how the project was built and walking through others on how to build it.

* The following projects are offered as suggestions. We will be willing to add additional projects if a community member suggests them.

* Please make project proposals to jabo38 before starting. Suggestions for new ideas are welcome too! Blogs should be written in Markdown (also the language of this forum for posting) and images for blogs hosted in the cloud. Previewing a blog written in Markdown can be done on http://dillinger.io/10.

* How to use NEM mosaics as in-game currency (use an open source JS game and reward high scores with mosaics that can be exchanged for badges). Bounty: 75,000 XEM (currently being worked on but possible to add additional projects. Please contact @jabo38 on Telegram for more details)

* How to create an inventory app using NEM (simple UI that allows the transfer of mosaic assets between “warehouses” -> addresses). Bounty: 150,000 XEM (currently being worked on)

* Build an alias/DNS module for NanoWallet similar to Emercoin's DNS. (on hold)

* How to make a stats viewer for NEM accounts (numeric/graphical presentation of account data with a well thought-out UI, filtering options, integrable into nano). Bounty: 25,000 XEM (Currently being worked on by Brucepro1)

* How to use NEM as a coupon system for business coupons. Should also be compatible with Nano wallet. Bounty: 50,000 XEM (Please contact @jabo38 on Telegram for more details)

* Build a key recovery service (KRS) that creates an of (n+1) multisig account. The KRS keeps the +1 private key and returns the other private keys to the user. When the user wants to retrieve the stored private key from the KRS, the KRS triggers calls a predefined webhook. Example: https://github.com/BitGo/key-recovery-service25. Bounty: 50,000 XEM (Currently being worked on by Aenima)

* Build an offline transaction notifier app and companion scanner app for creating an air-gapped wallet solution for NEM. Details can be found here17. Bounty 75,000 XEM (Please contact @jabo38 on Telegram for more details) (currently being worked on)

* Build a Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, and/or NEM Forum tipping bot. The more on chain, decentralized, and secure, the better. Please contact @jabo38 for more details. Bounty 50,000 XEM (Jon is currently working on Reddit. Victor is working on Twitter. Alvin is working on Facebook.)
